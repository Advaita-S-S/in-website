    <h1>Parallel Communication :</h1>
    <p>
        In parallel communication, we transfer a word or
        a byte at a time. Therefore, we need to have those
        many wires parallel to each other, each carrying a
        single bit. This is shown in Fig. 3.1, where eight
        wires are transmitting a byte at a time. In this
        example, the byte contains 10011001.

    This is a very fast method of transmitting
    data from one place to another. However, there
    are problems in this scheme. Firstly, it is a very
    expensive method because it requires several wires
    as well as various sending and receiving equipment.
    In addition, it demands extraordinary accuracy,
    which cannot be guaranteed over long distances.
    Digital pulses may not traverse at the same speed,because the underlying media through which the
    data passes from one computer system to another
    may not be absolutely or exactly identical. This gives
    rise to the problem of skew as shown in Fig. 3.2.

<p>
    When the skew happens, the bits 10011001 are
sent from the source to the destination, but they
traverse at different speeds. At the destination, the
measurements of signal values to determine whether
it was a bit 0 or 1 have to be done at the same time
for all the bits. Therefore, the problem of skew can
result in an inaccurate interpretation of bits.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid this problem, parallel transmission is
used only for a very short distance and there too,
all parallel wires have to be absolutely identical.
This method is used for data transmission within
the computer system such as from the CPU registers
to the memory or vice versa through the data bus.
The data bus essentially implements the parallel
transmission of data. This is done because speed,
rather than cost, is of paramount importance in
this case. However, due to the problems outlined above, one cannot use this method over long
distances.
