    <h1>ERROR CLASSIFICATION : </h1>
    <p>
        Let us fi rst discuss the three basic categories of errors.
        Delay distortion is caused because signals at different frequencies travel at different speeds
        along the medium. We know that any complex signal can be decomposed into different sinusoidal
        signals of different frequencies resulting in a frequency bandwidth for every signal. The property of
        signal propagation is such that the speed of travel of frequency at the center of this bandwidth is the
        highest, and this speed is low at both ends of the frequency bandwidth. Therefore, at the receiving
        end, signals with different frequencies in a given bandwidth will arrive at different times. Hence,
        at the receiving end, if the receiving frequencies are measured at a specifi c time, they will not
        measure up to the original signal resulting
        in its misinterpretation.

    Attenuation is another form of distortion.
    In this case, as a signal travels through any
    medium, its strength decreases, as shown in
    Fig. 4.1, just like our voice becomes weak
    over a distance and loses its contents beyond
    a certain distance.
</p>
<p>
    Attenuation is very small at short distances. The original signal therefore can be recognized as
    such without too much of distortion. Attenuation, however, increases with distance. This is because
    some of the signal energy is absorbed by the medium. Attenuation is higher at higher frequencies
    (another reason why there is a limit on the maximum frequency that can be transmitted through a
    medium). Techniques are available to equalize attenuation for a band of frequencies over a medium.
    For telephone lines, this is achieved by using loading coils that change the electrical properties
    of the wire to smooth out the effects due to attenuation. However, it cannot be done away with.
    One can use amplifi ers to boost the signal, but the amplifi er boosts not just the signal, but also the
    accompanying noise.
</p>
<p>
    Noise is yet another component, which poses a problem in receiving the signal accurately at
the receiver. We know that signals travel as electromagnetic signals through any medium. Some
electromagnetic energy can get inserted somewhere during transmission, which is normally called
noise. Apart from distortion and attenuation, noise is one of the major limiting factors in the
performance of any communication system.
In conclusion, the signal can change over a distance. It can, therefore, lead to a misinterpretation
of the signal (0 to 1 and vice versa). This can be very dangerous in many situations.
