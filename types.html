            <h1>TYPES OF MULTIPLEXING</h1>
<p>
    There are basically two ways in which multiplexing and demultiplexing can be achieved. They are
Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b> 1. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) : </b></li>
</ul>
<p>
   <b><i>Introduction : </i></b> 
</p>
<p>
    We are familiar with this technique used in public telephones. Frequency Division Multiplexing
(FDM) is also used in cable TV systems, where a single cable carries multiple video signals from
different channels or stations up to your TV set. With the remote control, we essentially activate
the electronic circuits in the television to select a specifi c frequency band or a channel. This is how we see a specifi c program on TV. The signals from other programs also actually traverse to your
TV set on the same cable, but they lie idle at your TV set for you to choose from.
In FDM, the medium is divided into a number of channels, each with a frequency bandwidth,
and therefore, a data rate. Though the composite signal ultimately carried by the medium is analog,
the input signals can be analog or digital. If the input signals are analog, multiplexers at both the
ends are suffi cient as shown in Fig. 3.18.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
    If the input signals are digital, such as from computers, they need to be passed through modems
and multiplexers as shown in Fig. 3.19. Modems convert the digital signals into analog signals and
then at the other end, convert them back into digital signals.

<p>
    <b><i>FDM and Analog Telephone System : </i></b> 
 </p>
<p>
    FDM is very important in the context of the analog telephone system. In the analog telephone
system, voice signals are carried over twisted copper wire pairs as analog signals from your home to the nearest exchange called last mile. There is no conversion from analog signals to their digital
equivalents at this stage of transmission. As we have noted previously, frequencies of human voice
that are carried by the telephone system are in the range of 0 to 4000 Hz (4 kHz). Therefore, to
carry a single voice conversation over telephone, a bandwidth of 4 kHz is necessary and suffi cient.
However, the capacity of the medium such as twisted wire pair or coaxial cable is far higher. That is
where FDM comes handy in enabling multiple conversations take place over a single wire or cable.
As we know, this is useful only in sending signals between exchanges or from a local exchange
to a higher level exchange. At an exchange, signals from multiple sources could be combined or
multiplexed and then sent to a higher or different exchange. At the other end, they are demultiplexed
and sent to the appropriate destinations. We must know that in a local loop, i.e., between the user
and the local exchange, there is only one user and therefore, multiplexing is not possible.
</p>
<p>
    In order to utilize the underlying infrastructure such as transmission equipment and switches to
the maximum possible extent, telephone companies make use of FDM. By multiplexing signals
from lines that have lower bandwidth onto those having higher bandwidth, maximum throughput
can be achieved. There are standards for this, such as how many smaller lines (also called channels)
should be combined into a bigger line, what should be the data rate, etc. These standards in Europe
and Japan are different from those in the US. However, the basic principles remain the same. As an
example, we shall briefl y discuss the structure used by AT&T in the US, as shown in Fig. 3.20.
</p>

</figure>
<ul>
    <li>
        1. At the first level, 12 voice channels, each having a bandwidth of 4 KHz, are multiplexed to
form a Group. This group has a bandwidth of 48 kHz. A question at this stage would be as
follows: Between any two channels, should there not be some unused empty portion (called
a guard band) provided, so that the signals of the two channels do not mingle with each
other, causing mixing of signals, and therefore, loss of information? The answer is no. As we
have discussed previously, the unused frequency bands of 0 to 300 Hz and 3300 to 4000 Hz
themselves act as guard bands, and the 300 to 3300 Hz portion is used for voice traffi c. The
FDM technique employed by AT&T has special equipment, which takes care of this issue.
Therefore, we can say that a 48 kHz Group can carry 12 voice signals, each consisting of
4 kHz.
    </li>
    <li>
        2. At the next level, 5 such groups are multiplexed to form a Supergroup. Thus, the bandwidth
of a Supergroup is 5 X 48 kHz = 240 kHz. In other words, a supergroup can carry 60 voice
signals, each of a bandwidth of 4 kHz.
    </li>
    <li>
        3. At the third level, 10 supergroups are multiplexed onto a channel of still higher bandwidth,
called Mastergroup. Thus, the bandwidth of a mastergroup channel is 10 X 240 kHz = 2.52
MHz. Thus, a mastergroup can carry 600 voice signals, each of a bandwidth of 4 kHz.
    </li>
    <li>
        4. At the last level, 6 mastergroup channels are combined to form a Jumbogroup. The bandwidth
of a jumbogroup is 6 X 2.52 MHz = 16.984 MHz. This means that a jumbogroup can carry
3600 voice conversations.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><b> 2. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) : </b></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a technique used for digital transmission only. In this case,
we do not divide the frequency bandwidth of a medium into a number of channels. We divide the
transmission time into a number of time slices. We then allocate each time slice to a different source
node, which wants to send some data. A node could mean a computer, a terminal or any device.
The time slice during which a source node is sending some data, the entire bandwidth belongs to
that source node. We know that the data rate in a medium is proportional to its bandwidth. Hence,
the source node, which is sending some data during that time slice, can send the data at a high rate.
However, because the total time span is divided into a number of time slices, the overall data rate
from each source node again reduces. Therefore, the concept of a medium being divided into a
number of channels is still a logically valid one.
</p>
<p>
    It is thinkable but not practicable to allocate a large chunk of time to a source node until that
source node completes its transmission, and then allocate another large chunk of time to the next
source node and so on.
However, in this case, the time slice allocated to each source would be different because the
time is allocated to a source node until it completes transmission; and each node may want different
amount of data to be transmitted. This philosophy may require large amount of buffers at each
source node to hold the data when some other source node is transmitting. In addition, this method
can be very unfair to a few source nodes as it may involve long waits or indefi nite postponement,
if one of the source nodes grabs the medium for a very long time.
This is the reason why the time span is divided into equal time slices. There are two ways of
allocating the time slices to various source nodes. They are given below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Synchronous TDM, also known as TDM
    </li>
    <li>
        Statistical TDM
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b> Synchronous TDM or TDM </b>
</p>
<p>
    In the technique called synchronous TDM, also called only TDM, the time slice is allocated to a
source node regardless of whether it wants to send some data or not. This is a simpler mechanism
to identify at a destination node as to which data originated from which source node. This is on the
basis of a fi xed time slot. Therefore, the position of data within the data frame specifi es its origin.
However, it can be a very wasteful scheme, because the time slot is allotted to a source node even
if it has nothing to send. Figure 3.21 illustrates this scheme.
</p>
<p>
    A small buffer memory is associated with every source node. At any time, not all nodes may
want to send some data. Regardless of this, the timing device in the multiplexer allocates some
time for each node to transmit data from its buffer, and then repeats this cycle, e.g., A-B-C-D-A-B-C-D, etc., as shown in the fi gure. By the time its turn comes next, if a node wants to transmit any
data, it will have moved a small chunk of data to its buffer. If there was no data to be transmitted,
the buffer will be empty, but then it will still be sent, as depicted in Fig. 3.21. (Refer to node B).
Notice that there is no addressing scheme here to identify the source of data. The position of data
in the composite message determines the source address.

<p>
    <b> Statistical Time Division Multiplexing (STDM)</b>
</p>
<p>
    Statistical Time Division Multiplexing (STDM) is a variation of the TDM technique. This technique
is more intelligent. It monitors which machine or terminal is sending the data more frequently
and in more quantity, and allocates the time slices more often to those nodes. Relatively inactive
computers/terminals get the time slice less often, while a completely idle computer/terminal may
not get any time slice at all. Essentially statistics is maintained about the activity of various source
nodes and hence the name. This is shown in Fig. 3.22. In the fi gure, node B does not send any data
at all, while node C is more active, and hence is polled more frequently.
This allows more number of computers/terminals to be connected to the line. For instance, on
a 9.6 Kbps line, you could connect only 8 terminals sending data at the rate of 1200 Kbps or 1.2
Kbps using ordinary TDM. With STDM, you could connect more number of terminals, because, at
a given time, not all terminals are normally active, and wanting to send data. This technique will
work, so long as the number of terminals wanting to send data at any moment does not exceed 8.
</p>
<p>
    It should be obvious that the position of data in the total data frames sent does not determine
its address. In TDM, this was the case. In STDM, a time slot could be allotted to any of the nodes
depending upon its past activity, and present requests. Therefore, in STDM, along with the chunk of
data, some control information is sent in the data frame, which contains the addresses of both, the
sender and the receiver as well as the number of bytes sent, etc. At the destination, another stat mux
(a statistical multiplexer is called stat mux) captures the frame, separates out the data chunks and
the receivers address and sends data to the appropriate destination. Here, the senders address tells the receiver (destination) from whom the data has been received. This is unlike in TDM where the
sender was defi ned by the time slot and therefore, it was not necessary to send the senders address
explicitly. Thus, in STDM, having to send addresses along with the actual data is an overhead, but
then it obviated the need of sending nulls if a node did not want to send anything at all (as was the
case with TDM). In most cases, this increases the effective throughput of the system.

    <b> Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)</b>
</p>
<p>
    If the transmission medium is not copper wire but it is optical fi ber, a variation of the basic FDM
scheme is used. In this scheme called Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), transmissions
from multiple optical fibers are combined and sent together. In order to ensure that these
transmissions from different optical fi bers do not overlap with each other and that they do not get
mixed, their wavelengths are considered as the point of difference. In other words, just as in the
case of FDM, the transmissions from various sources are combined and sent together on the basis
of their different frequencies; here the transmissions are combined on the basis of the difference
between the wavelengths. So, the process in brief is that transmissions from various optical fi bers
are combined on the sender’s side. These transmissions have different wavelengths. The combined
transmission is sent to the other side via a single and more powerful optical fi ber. At the receiver’s
end, the individual transmissions are retrieved by fi ltering out the individual source signals on the
basis of their wavelengths.
</p>
<p>
    WDM is very similar to FDM, except that very high frequencies are used in WDM. Also, because
it is based on optical principles and not electrical principles, it has very high accuracy as compared
to FDM. Modern research allows as many as 200 different channels to share a single high capacityoptical fi ber line. In such a case, where a signifi cant number of input sources are combined into a
single channel, we call it as Dense WDM (DWDM).
The concept of WDM is illustrated in Fig. 3.25.
