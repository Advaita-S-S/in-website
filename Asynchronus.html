    <h1>Asynchronus Communication :</h1>
    <p>
        We have learnt why serial communication is preferred to parallel communication over a long
distance. However, we have only one problem in serial communication, i.e., how do we identify
individual bits? Essentially, the problem is that of synchronizing the sender (source) and the receiver
(destination) as outlined above.
    </p>

<p>
    In asynchronous communication, the time when a character will be sent cannot be predicted.
Imagine, for instance, a data entry operator. S/he may key in a few characters, then may consult
her/his boss, then key in a few more characters before s/he goes off for lunch. In such a scenario,
where the data is transmitted as characters and at an unpredictable pace, we have to synchronize
the source and destination for each character. This is called asynchronous communication.
</p>
<p>
    In this case, each character is preceded with a start bit and succeeded with 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits.
    Figure 3.5 depicts this. Normally NRZ-L signaling is used for asynchronous transmission. According
    to this convention, a negative voltage denotes a binary 1 bit and a positive voltage denotes a binary
    0 bit. When the line is idle, i.e., when no character is being sent over the line, a constant negative
    voltage signifying a binary "1"is generated. When the character is to be sent, fi rst, a bit, which is
    bit 0 is sent. This is called start bit. A positive voltage is generated according to the convention to
    denote this. All the 5 to 8 bits of the character according to the coding scheme used (Baudot, BCD,
    ASCII, EBCDIC) then follow; each of which could have a 0 or 1 value. A parity bit, if used, then
    follows. In the end, 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits are added. The stop bit again corresponds to the idle state,
    which is bit 1. In this context 1.5 bits only means that the signal with negative voltage denoting
    1 is generated for 1.5 times the normal bit interval. The sender and receiver have to exactly agree
    on the number of bits that represent a character (5, 6, 7 or 8); the parity bit scheme, if used; the bit
    interval (or bit rate); and also what represents 0 and 1 (NRZ-L).
</p>

<p>
    Essentially, when the start bit is recognized by the destination, it knows that a character is being
sent. It then adjusts and starts its clock so that measurement of signal values can now start in the
middle of every bit that follows for the expected number of bits. After all the bits in the character
including the parity bit are measured and stored, it expects a stop bit, which is encountered if
everything is OK. This is to recognize the bits being sent. This continues until the stop bit is received.
At this time, the line becomes idle, and the destination clock also goes to sleep. On receiving the
start bit, it wakes up for the duration of that character, and after the full character is received, it
again goes to sleep until the next character arrives. This makes sense where (a) the rate at which
the characters arrive is unpredictable and (b) the speed at which the characters are keyed in is far
less than the speed with which they are transmitted or processed.
</p>
<p>
    There has to be a proper understanding between the source and destination about the bit rate in
bps, from which, bit interval can be computed to determine when the signal measurements have to be taken. Using this, the destination waits for the start bit and then starts its clock to measure the
signal values to recognize the bits including the parity bits.
